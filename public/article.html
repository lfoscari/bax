        <p>Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of 'newness' and 'experimentalism,' then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It's getting fucking old. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing.</p>
        <p>You won't get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Respect your fucking craft. The graphic designer's first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Learn from fucking criticism.</p>

        <p>Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It's getting fucking old. Paul Rand once said, "The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring." You won't get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Don't fucking lie to yourself. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic.</p>
        <p>You are not your fucking work. Don't get hung up on things that don't fucking work. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Must-do is a good fucking master.</p>

        <p>A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space.
